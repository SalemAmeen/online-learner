In addition to the usual (torch, nnx, etc.) this demo requires the 
following modules to be installed via luarocks:
imgraph
opencv
inline

You will need to have OpenCV installed for the opencv module.

$ brew install opencv

To install OpenCV on Ubuntu (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV)
$ sudo apt-get install libcv2.1 libcvaux2.1 libhighgui2.1 python-opencv opencv-doc libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev

You will need the Boost libraries installed for the imgraph module.
