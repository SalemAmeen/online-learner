In addition to the usual (torch, nnx, etc.) this demo requires the 
following modules to be installed via luarocks:
imgraph
opencv
inline

You will need to have OpenCV installed for the opencv module. You will need
the Boost libraries installed for the imgraph module.

To install Boost on Mac OSX with Homebrew
$ brew install boost

To install Boost on Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
